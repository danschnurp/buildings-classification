Abstract
--
The aim of this work is to develop an application that will classify a loaded image of the object (building) from a built-in mobile device or mobile camera into one of the architectural styles such as gothic, renaissance, baroque, art nouveau, functionalism, and others. The application will be designed for the mobile device or as a web application for accessibility over the Internet. The classifier used in the application will be based on convolutional neural network.
